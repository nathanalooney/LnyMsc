# LnyMsc
Spiritual precursor to CloudLibr.io. Music blog built with node.js and mongodb which let me post songs via a chrome extension whenever I was on a songs page on SoundCloud, allowed sorting via 'mood' and genre for curated playlists by yours truly.

##Description
LnyMsc was the first app I ever developed using node.js, largely as a learning tool. It was a simple single page application hosted on heroku. It utilized HTML5/CSS3/Javascript and jQuery, and made use of an API hosted on the same heroku server built with Express. The website was essentially a way for me to post music I was finding and have it sorted by different "Moods", defined as  "Exciting", "Mellow", "Heavy", "Hazey", and "Bouncey". I could post to the website from any song's SoundCloud page using a chrome extension I built that would post to my node app's ADD endpoint, meaning my actual time spent on the site was negligible, and adding to the site was as easy as clicking "Repost" on SoundCloud's own page.

The website and mongoDB instance have been offline for well over a year at this point.
